# ðŸŒŠ My Neovim Config
Learning vim motions and nvim because it looks cool and I want to be cool

## What's Inside?

- Plugins that looked useful
- Some custom keybindings and settings
- WSL2 clipboard support
- LSP configuration for various languages
- Basic file explorer and search setup

## Usage

```bash
git clone this-repo ~/.config/nvim
nvim
# and you're good to go
```

## Fair Warning

This is my personal config, so know that it will change as I continue to learn and try new things. Feel free to fork it, modify it, or use it as inspiration for your own setup. No guarantees, but it works for me most of the time.
